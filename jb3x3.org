** Overview
The jb3x3 is a cheap, dead simple 3x3 macropad powered by an Arduino Pro Micro, chosen for its slim profile, HID capability, and low cost.

The PCB files for production can be found in ~jb3x3_pcb_files.zip~ where they can be uploaded to a service such as JLCPCB. The bottom plate is stored in the ~3x3pcb.dxf~ file.

Originally designed for use with Zoom, the keypad has infinite uses – Discord shortcuts, convenient macro keys, or control a livestream with ease.

For a batch of 10 PCBs the cost came out to less than $15 per unit, not including labor/solder/tools.

** Parts
The keypad is designed for a Cherry MX-compatible switch, meaning many common, cheap switches can be used. I used "Otemu" switches - very cheap but functional. The controller is designed to be an Arduino Pro Micro, ideally flashed with QMK (but manual programming is of course possible).

** General Steps
1) Setup QMK environment
   + https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/tutorial/newbs_getting_started
2) Make jb3x3 keyboard: ~qmk new-keymap -kb jb3x3~
3) Make new folder in ~jb3x3/keymaps~ (if it gets created from the above step just transfer files)
4) Make new ~keymap.c~ file
5) Edit/configure keymap (written in C obviously)
   + Reference section [[Notes re: Programming]]
6) Compile: ~qmk compile -kb jb3x3 -km <keymap>~
7) Flash the .hex file to keyboard, I recommend the GUI tool but I'm sure you'll figure it out
   + When flashing you need to put the Arduino into the proper mode, I think just short GND/RST, then plug in the keyboard, then disconnect
   + It'll show up in the software a bit differently
   + Let me know if you have issues with this, haven't done it in a while
     
** Notes re: Programming
+ ~jakebox/keymap.c~ is a good reference
+ https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/simple-keycodes/keycodes
+ [[https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/simple-keycodes/feature_advanced_keycodes][Modifier keys]] are keys wrapped in, for example, ~LCTRL(kc)~
  * These can of course be stacked
+ Can use ~MO(#)~ to shift to a mod layer easily (this is my preferred method)
  * While they key is held shift to another layer
  * Corresponding key on the layer you're shifting to needs to have ~KC_TRNS~
  * See ~teacher_mac/keymap.c~
